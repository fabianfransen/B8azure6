    abstract "BACKGROUND: Non-syndromic intellectual disability is genetically
 heterogeneous with dominant, recessive and complex forms of inheritance. We
 have performed detailed genetic studies in a large multi-generational Swedish
 family, including several members diagnosed with non-syndromic intellectual
 disability. Linkage analysis was performed on 22 family members, nine
 affected with mild to moderate intellectual disability and 13 unaffected
 family members. METHODS: Family members were analyzed with Affymetrix
 Genome-Wide Human SNP Array 6.0 and the genetic data was used to detect copy
 number variation and to perform genome wide linkage analysis with the SNP
 High Throughput Linkage analysis system and the Merlin software. For the
 exome sequencing, the samples were prepared using the Sure Select Human All
 Exon Kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) and sequenced using the
 Ion Proton System. Validation of identified variants was performed with
 Sanger sequencing. RESULTS: The linkage analysis results indicate that
 intellectual disability in this family is genetically heterogeneous, with
 suggestive linkage found on chromosomes 1q31-q41, 4q32-q35, 6p25 and
 14q24-q31 (LOD scores of 2.4, simulated p-value of 0.000003 and a simulated
 genome-wide p-value of 0.06). Exome sequencing was then performed in 14
 family members and 7 unrelated individuals from the same region. The analysis
 of coding variation revealed a pathogenic and candidate variants in different
 branches of the family. In three patients we find a known homozygous
 pathogenic mutation in the Homo sapiens solute carrier family 17 member 5
 (SLC17A5), causing Salla disease. We also identify a deletion overlapping
 KDM3B and a duplication overlapping MAP3K4 and AGPAT4, both overlapping
 variants previously reported in developmental disorders. CONCLUSIONS: DNA
 samples from the large family analyzed in this study were initially collected
 based on a hypothesis that affected members shared a major genetic risk
 factor. Our results show that a complex phenotype such as mild intellectual
 disability in large families from genetically isolated populations may show
 considerable genetic heterogeneity.",

    abstract "By using exome sequencing and a gene matching approach, we
 identified de novo and inherited pathogenic variants in KDM3B in 14 unrelated
 individuals and three affected parents with varying degrees of intellectual
 disability (ID) or developmental delay (DD) and short stature. The
 individuals share additional phenotypic features that include feeding
 difficulties in infancy, joint hypermobility, and characteristic facial
 features such as a wide mouth, a pointed chin, long ears, and a low
 columella. Notably, two individuals developed cancer, acute myeloid leukemia
 and Hodgkin lymphoma, in childhood. KDM3B encodes for a histone demethylase
 and is involved in H3K9 demethylation, a crucial part of chromatin
 modification required for transcriptional regulation. We identified missense
 and truncating variants, suggesting that KDM3B haploinsufficiency is the
 underlying mechanism for this syndrome. By using a hybrid facial-recognition
 model, we show that individuals with a pathogenic variant in KDM3B have a
 facial gestalt, and that they show significant facial similarity compared to
 control individuals with ID. In conclusion, pathogenic variants in KDM3B
 cause a syndrome characterized by ID, short stature, and facial dysmorphism.",
